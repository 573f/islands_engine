# Islands Engine

Project from the [Educative](https://www.educative.io) course [Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP and Phoenix](https://www.educative.io/courses/functional-web-development-elixir-otp-phoenix).

From the course materials:
> It’s a game for two players. Each player has a board that consists of a grid of a hundred coordinates. The grid is labeled with the numbers 1 through 10 across the top for the columns and down the left side for the rows. We name individual coordinates with this row-column combination. The players cannot see each other’s boards.

>The players have matching sets of islands varying in shapes and sizes. They place these islands on their own boards. The players can move the islands around as much as they like until they say that they are set. After that, the islands must stay where they are for the rest of the game.

> Once both players have set their islands, they take turns guessing coordinates on their opponent’s board, trying to find the islands. For every correct guess, we plant a palm tree on the island at that coordinate. When all the coordinates for an island have palm trees, the island is forested.

> The first player to forest all their opponent’s islands is the winner.
